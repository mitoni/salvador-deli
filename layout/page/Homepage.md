              ## Who are we?


              We’re Courtney Cotherman and Linda Moore!


              You may know us from **Kilted Mermaid**, The Kilted Mermaid Wine
              Club (our first collaboration), or you may have seen us around
              town.


              We love the hospitality business, so we decided to team up
              together. We’re so excited to bring **“Artfully Elevated Pub
              Food”** to you!

              Stay tuned for more information and updates!


              Cheers!
